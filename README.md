## Description

This project is an attempt to clean up the existing Horiseon website. To do this, I consolodated CSS elements and sections, repaired broken links, renamed sections of the html to follow a traditional heirarchy, added alt attributes to picures and links, and commented both the CSS and HTML to provide ease of use. 

The resulting website has navigation that is complete and follows accesibility standards for html. 

I learned a lot about how to properly organize a webpage so that other developers and users can easily view, navigate, add to, or edit this site. I also was able to learn and practice git procedures for pushing, pulling, branching, adding files, commiting, creating pull requests, and merging branches through github.
